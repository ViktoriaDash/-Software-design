# Особливості дотримання принципів програмування в моєму коді


### DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself):
* The DRY principle is followed by using methods to output information about animals and workers, which avoids code duplication.


### KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)
* The code is simple and clear, each class performs one specific function.


### SOLID
* Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):** Each class has a single responsibility.
* Open/Closed Principle (OCP):** Classes are open for extension but closed for modification.
* Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):** Subclasses can replace base classes.
* Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):** Interfaces are separated into specific ones.
* Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):** High-level modules do not depend on low-level modules.


### YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)
* Added only necessary functionality for the task.


### Composition Over Inheritance
* Composition is used to create complex objects.


### Program to Interfaces not Implementations
* Interfaces are used for interaction between classes.


### Fail Fast
* Input checks and error handling are performed at the start of execution.
